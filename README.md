# PCCR and RNA Binding Proteins (RBP)

Track hub for hg19 and hg38

eCLIP peaks of RBP and shRNA-KD of the same RBP in HepG2 cell line

Two types of tracks are avaliable:

## RNA bridges
Long-range RNA structures approximating the binding site of an RBP to the regulated exon. 
We serached for candidate binding sites of all RBPs profiled in the panel of eCLIP experiments that were located within 50 nts from a CCR, on one hand, and exons located within 50 nts from its mate CCR, on the other hand. The exon inclusion rate significantly respond to RBP knockdown.

## loop out
Long-range RNA structure that loop out an exon and contain an RBP binding site within 50 nts from one of the CCRs, under the requirement that exon inclusion rate significantly respond to RBP knockdown.

shRNA-KD tracks elements have red color, if exon dPSI = PSI KD - PSI CTR > 0 and blue color, if dPSI < 0
